 BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular (CV) benefits of sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors have been attributed, in part, to cardiac reverse remodelling. The EMPA-HEART CardioLink-6 study reported that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition for 6 months with empagliflozin was associated with a significant reduction in left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (LVMi). In this sub-analysis, we evaluated whether baseline LVMi may influence how empagliflozin affects cardiac reverse remodelling. METHODS: A total of 97 patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease were randomized to empagliflozin (10Â mg/d) or matching placebo for 6 months. The study cohort was divided into those whose baseline LVMi was â‰¤â€‰60Â g/m(2) and those who had a baseline LVMiâ€‰>â€‰60Â g/m(2). Subgroup comparisons were conducted using a linear regression model adjusted for baseline values (ANCOVA) that included an interaction term between LVMi subgroup and treatment. RESULTS: Baseline LVMi was 53.3Â g/m(2) (49.2-57.2) and 69.7Â g/m(2) (64.2-76.1) for those with baselineâ€‰â‰¤â€‰60Â g/m(2) (nâ€‰=â€‰54) and LVMiâ€‰>â€‰60Â g/m(2) (nâ€‰=â€‰43) respectively. The adjusted difference of LVMi regression between those randomized to empagliflozin and placebo were -â€‰0.46Â g/m(2) (95% CI: -3.44, 2.52, pâ€‰=â€‰0.76) in the baseline LVMiâ€‰â‰¤â€‰60Â g/m(2) subgroup and -â€‰7.26Â g/m(2) (95% CI: -11.40, -3.12, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0011) in the baseline LVMiâ€‰>â€‰60Â g/m(2) subgroup (p-for-interactionâ€‰=â€‰0.007). No significant associations were found between baseline LVMi and 6-month change in LV end systolic volume-indexed (p-for-interactionâ€‰=â€‰0.086), LV end diastolic volume-indexed (p-for-interactionâ€‰=â€‰0.34), or LV ejection fraction (p-for-interactionâ€‰=â€‰0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with higher LVMi at baseline experienced greater LVM regression with empagliflozin.
