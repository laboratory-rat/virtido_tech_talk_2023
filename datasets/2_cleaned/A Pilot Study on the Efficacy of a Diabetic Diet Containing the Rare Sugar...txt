 High sugar consumption increases the risk of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Regarding the diet of patients with diabetes, artificial sweeteners are considered a safe alternative to sugar; however, there is also a risk that artificial sweeteners exacerbate glucose metabolism. D-allulose (C-3 isomer of d-fructose), which is a rare sugar, has been reported to have antidiabetic and antiobesity effects. In this study, the efficacy of a diabetic diet containing D-allulose was investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes using an intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring system (isCGM). This study was a validated, prospective, single-blind, randomized, crossover comparative study. Comparison of peak postprandial blood glucose (PPG) levels after consumption of a standard diabetic diet and a diabetic diet containing 8.5 g of D-allulose was the primary endpoint. A D-allulose-containing diabetic diet improved PPG levels in type two diabetes patients compared with a strictly energy-controlled diabetic diet. The results also showed a protective effect on endogenous pancreatic insulin secretory capacity owing to reduced insulin requirement. In patients with type two diabetes mellitus, diabetic diets containing 8.5 g D-allulose were effective in improving PPG levels.
