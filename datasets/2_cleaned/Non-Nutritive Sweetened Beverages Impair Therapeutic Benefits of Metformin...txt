 Metformin, a frontline therapy for type 2 diabetes and related metabolic diseases, results in variable outcomes. This study aimed to investigate whether sweetened beverages (caloric or non-caloric) affect the therapeutic benefits of metformin on glucose, food intake, and weight loss in diet-induced obesity. Mice were given a high-fat diet and sweetened water for 8 weeks to induce obesity and glucose intolerance. Then, mice were randomized to receive metformin in either water, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), or the non-nutritive sweetener saccharin for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks of metformin treatment, all groups had improved glucose tolerance compared to pretreatment. However, saccharin resulted in worse glucose tolerance and weight gain outcomes than the water or HFCS groups and correlated with lower plasma growth differentiation factor 15 levels. In conclusion, reducing non-nutritive sweetener consumption during metformin therapy is recommended to avoid impairing the therapeutic effects of metformin on body weight and glucose homeostasis.
