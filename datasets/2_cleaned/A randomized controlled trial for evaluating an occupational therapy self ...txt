 This study evaluated the efficacy of the Occupational Therapy Diabetes Self-Management intervention (OTDSM) to enhance glycemic stability and self-management skills in people with diabetes type-2. Based on this single-blind randomized trial, 30 subjects with diabetes type-2 were assigned to two groups of intervention and control. The intervention group received a 10-week program, consisting of four group visits and six individualized sessions. The control group received an individual session and three weekly phone calls. The primary study outcome, blood hemoglobin A1C, was measured before and three months after the study. The secondary outcome was assessed in terms of the participants' self-management behaviors, self-efficacy, diabetes distress, depressive symptoms, and performance and satisfaction with daily activities. These outcomes were evaluated three times: before, one month into, and three months after the study. The study findings demonstrated significant differences between the two groups in the hemoglobin A1C levels, self-management behaviors, self-efficacy, and performance and satisfaction with daily routines after the intervention (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). No significant differences existed between the groups for the extent of diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. Inclusion of occupational therapy protocol into the plan of care for people with diabetes can improve health outcomes by promoting their routine participation in self-management activities.
