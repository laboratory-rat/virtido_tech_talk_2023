 AIMS: SMARTEST is a register-based randomized clinical trial (RRCT) that compares dapagliflozin to metformin in early-stage type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome includes progression of microvascular complications based on data from the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR). In this sub-study, the aim was to validate microvascular complication variables in the NDR against electronic health records (EHRs). METHODS: Data were extracted from EHRs of 276 SMARTEST participants with a median observation period of 3Â years in the Uppsala, Ã–rebro and SÃ¶rmland counties and compared with NDR data. Agreement was determined for all corresponding data entries as well as for progression of microvascular complications after randomization. RESULTS: The agreement for all corresponding data entries was 98.9% (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient 0.999) for creatinine and eGFR, 95.1% for albuminuria, 91.6% for foot-at-risk and 98.2% for retinopathy status (Kappa 0.67-0.91). The agreement for progression of microvascular complications was 98.0% for CKD stage, 98.9% for albuminuria grade, 96.3% for foot-at-risk grade and 99.6% for retinopathy grade progression (Gwet's AC(1) 0.96-1.00). CONCLUSION: Microvascular complication variables in the NDR show good agreement with EHR data. The use of a well-established national health care registry, exemplified by the NDR, for endpoint collection in RRCTs such as SMARTEST is supported by this study.
