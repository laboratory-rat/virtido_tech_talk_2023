 BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the long-term effects of tofogliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, on atherosclerosis progression and major clinical parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes lacking an apparent history of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: This was a prospective observational 2-year extension study of the "Using TOfogliflozin for Possible better Intervention against Atherosclerosis for type 2 diabetes patients (UTOPIA)" trial, a 2-year randomized intervention study. The primary endpoints represented changes in the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). Secondary endpoints included brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and biomarkers for glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, renal function, and cardiovascular risks. RESULTS: The mean IMT of the common carotid artery (IMT-CCA) significantly decreased in both the tofogliflozin (-â€‰0.067Â mm, standard error 0.009, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and conventional treatment groups (-â€‰0.080Â mm, SE 0.009, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) throughout the follow-up period; however, no significant intergroup differences in the changes (0.013Â mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -â€‰0.012 to 0.037, pâ€‰=â€‰0.32) were observed in a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. baPWV significantly increased in the conventional treatment group (82.7â€‰Â±â€‰210.3Â cm/s, pâ€‰=â€‰0.008) but not in the tofogliflozin group (-â€‰17.5â€‰Â±â€‰221.3Â cm/s, pâ€‰=â€‰0.54), resulting in a significant intergroup difference in changes (-â€‰100.2Â cm/s, 95% CI -â€‰182.8 to -â€‰17.5, pâ€‰=â€‰0.018). Compared to the conventional treatment group, tofogliflozin significantly improved the hemoglobin A1c and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, body mass index, abdominal circumference, and systolic blood pressure. The frequencies of total and serious adverse events did not vary significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Tofogliflozin was not associated with improved inhibition of carotid wall thickening but exerted long-term positive effects on various cardiovascular risk factors and baPWV while showing a good safety profile.
