 OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia has been recognized as a third category of complications in people with diabetes. However, few studies focus on the reduction of skeletal muscle mass in young people with diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors of pre-sarcopenia in young patients with diabetes and establish a practical tool to diagnose pre-sarcopenia in those people. METHODS: Patients (nâ€‰=â€‰1246) enrolled from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycle year of 2011 to 2018 were randomly divided into the training set and validation set. The all-subsets regression analysis was used to select the risk factors of pre-sarcopenia. A nomogram model for the prediction of pre-sarcopenia in the diabetic population was established based on the risk factors. The model was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for discrimination, calibration curves for calibration, and decision curve analysis curves for clinical utility. RESULTS: In this study, gender, height, and waist circumference were elected as predictive factors for pre-sarcopenia. The nomogram model presented excellent discrimination in training and validation sets with areas under the curve of 0.907 and 0.912, respectively. The calibration curve illustrated excellent calibration, and the decision curve analysis showed a wide range of good clinical utility. CONCLUSIONS: This study develops a novel nomogram that integrates gender, height, and waist circumference and can be used to easily predict pre-sarcopenia in diabetics. The novel screen tool is accurate, specific, and low-cost, highlighting its potential value in clinical application.
