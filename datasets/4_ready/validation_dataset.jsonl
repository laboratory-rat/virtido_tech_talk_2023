{"prompt":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cytoflavin in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Investigational therapy was administered in two steps: intravenous infusions of experimental drug\/placebo for 10 days followed by oral administration for 75 days. In 10 clinical centers, 216 patients aged 45-74 years with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, symptomatic distal sensorimotor DPN, confirmed no earlier than 1 year before screening, on stable therapy (no change of drugs and doses) by oral hypoglycemic drugs, intermediate-acting, long-acting or extra-long-acting insulin, and\/or GLP-1 receptor agonists. RESULTS: By the end of treatment, the change of the Total Symptom Score (TSS) in the experimental group was -2.65 points, in the placebo group -1.73 points (p<0.001). Improvement of symptoms in the experimental group was achieved regardless of the degree of compensation for type 2 diabetes (both in those with Hb1Ac <8.0% and in those with Hb1Ac \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a58.0%), but demonstrated better results in patients with less severe baseline symptoms (TSS <7.5). Improvement in the components of the TSS scale \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00abparesthesia\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00bb and \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00abnumbness\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00bb occurred as early as on day 11 of therapy; by the end of treatment, a significant decrease in the \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00abburning\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00bb component was also demonstrated. The experimental drug had a positive safety profile. CONCLUSION: Cytoflavin, intravenous solution and enteric-coated tablets (SPTF Polysan Ltd.) is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of DPN.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" diabetic polyneuropathy\nic\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus\nle.

{"prompt":"High sugar consumption increases the risk of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Regarding the diet of patients with diabetes, artificial sweeteners are considered a safe alternative to sugar; however, there is also a risk that artificial sweeteners exacerbate glucose metabolism. D-allulose (C-3 isomer of d-fructose), which is a rare sugar, has been reported to have antidiabetic and antiobesity effects. In this study, the efficacy of a diabetic diet containing D-allulose was investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes using an intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring system (isCGM). This study was a validated, prospective, single-blind, randomized, crossover comparative study. Comparison of peak postprandial blood glucose (PPG) levels after consumption of a standard diabetic diet and a diabetic diet containing 8.5 g of D-allulose was the primary endpoint. A D-allulose-containing diabetic diet improved PPG levels in type two diabetes patients compared with a strictly energy-controlled diabetic diet. The results also showed a protective effect on endogenous pancreatic insulin secretory capacity owing to reduced insulin requirement. In patients with type two diabetes mellitus, diabetic diets containing 8.5 g D-allulose were effective in improving PPG levels.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" diabetes\npatients\ntype 2 diabetes\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt":"INTRODUCTION: Relationships between glycemic-lowering effects of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and impact on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes are uncertain. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 4395 individuals with prebaseline and postbaseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) randomized to canagliflozin (n=2193) or placebo (n=2202) in The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation trial. Effects on HbA1c were assessed using mixed models. Mediation of treatment effects by achieved glycemic control was analyzed using proportional hazards regression with and without adjustment for achieved HbA1c. End points included combined kidney or cardiovascular death, end-stage kidney disease or doubling of serum creatinine (primary trial outcome), and individual end point components. RESULTS: HbA1c lowering was modified by baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). For baseline eGFR 60-90, 45-59, and 30-44\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0mL\/min\/1.73 m(2), overall HbA1c (canagliflozin vs placebo) decreased by -0.24%, -0.14%, and -0.08% respectively and likelihood of >0.5% decrease in HbA1c decreased with ORs of 1.47 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.67), 1.12 (0.94 to 1.33) and 0.99 (0.83 to 1.18), respectively. Adjustment for postbaseline HbA1c marginally attenuated canagliflozin effects on primary and kidney composite outcomes: unadjusted HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.80) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.81); adjusted for week 13 HbA1c, HR 0.71 (95% CI 0.060 to 0.84) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.83). Results adjusted for time-varying HbA1c or HbA1c as a cubic spline were similar and consistent with preserved clinical benefits across a range of excellent and poor glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: The glycemic effects of canagliflozin are attenuated at lower eGFR but effects on kidney and cardiac end points are preserved. Non-glycemic effects may be primarily responsible for the kidney and cardioprotective benefits of canagliflozin.22.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" s of canaglifl\nDiabetes\nindividuals\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt":"This study evaluated the efficacy of the Occupational Therapy Diabetes Self-Management intervention (OTDSM) to enhance glycemic stability and self-management skills in people with diabetes type-2. Based on this single-blind randomized trial, 30 subjects with diabetes type-2 were assigned to two groups of intervention and control. The intervention group received a 10-week program, consisting of four group visits and six individualized sessions. The control group received an individual session and three weekly phone calls. The primary study outcome, blood hemoglobin A1C, was measured before and three months after the study. The secondary outcome was assessed in terms of the participants' self-management behaviors, self-efficacy, diabetes distress, depressive symptoms, and performance and satisfaction with daily activities. These outcomes were evaluated three times: before, one month into, and three months after the study. The study findings demonstrated significant differences between the two groups in the hemoglobin A1C levels, self-management behaviors, self-efficacy, and performance and satisfaction with daily routines after the intervention (P\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0<\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u00b00.05). No significant differences existed between the groups for the extent of diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. Inclusion of occupational therapy protocol into the plan of care for people with diabetes can improve health outcomes by promoting their routine participation in self-management activities.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Occupational Therapy Diabetes Self-Management intervention\nsubjects\ndiabetes type-2\nople with\nOTDSM\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of treatment on pregnancy outcomes among women who had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 5.1-5.6 mmol\/l in the first trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: We performed a secondary-analysis of a randomized community non-inferiority trial of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) screening. All pregnant women with FPG values range 5.1-5.6 mmol\/l in the first trimester of gestation were included in the present study (n=3297) and classified to either the (i) intervention group who received treatment for GDM along with usual prenatal care (n=1,198), (ii) control group who received usual-prenatal-care (n=2,099). Macrosomia\/large for gestational age (LGA) and primary cesarean-section (C-S) were considered as primary-outcomes. A modified-Poisson-regression for binary outcome data with a log link function and robust error variance was used to RR (95%CI) for the associations between GDM status and incidence of pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: The mean maternal age and BMI of pregnant women in both study groups were similar. There were no statistically significant differences in the adjusted risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including macrosomia, primary C-S, preterm birth, hyperbilirubinemia, preeclampsia, NICU-admission, birth trauma, and LBW both groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is found that treating women with first-trimester FPG values of 5.1-5.6 mmol\/l could not improve adverse pregnancy outcomes including macrosomia, Primary C-S, Preterm birth, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, preeclampsia, NICU admission, Birth trauma and LBW. Therefore, extrapolating the FPG cut-off point of the second trimester to the first -which has been proposed by the IADPSG, might therefore not be appropriate.
