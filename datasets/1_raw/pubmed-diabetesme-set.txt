AB  - BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular (CV) benefits of sodium-glucose transport protein 
      2 inhibitors have been attributed, in part, to cardiac reverse remodelling. The 
      EMPA-HEART CardioLink-6 study reported that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
      inhibition for 6 months with empagliflozin was associated with a significant 
      reduction in left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (LVMi). In this 
      sub-analysis, we evaluated whether baseline LVMi may influence how empagliflozin 
      affects cardiac reverse remodelling. METHODS: A total of 97 patients with type 2 
      diabetes and coronary artery disease were randomized to empagliflozin (10 mg/d) 
      or matching placebo for 6 months. The study cohort was divided into those whose 
      baseline LVMi was ≤ 60 g/m(2) and those who had a baseline LVMi > 60 g/m(2). 
      Subgroup comparisons were conducted using a linear regression model adjusted for 
      baseline values (ANCOVA) that included an interaction term between LVMi subgroup 
      and treatment. RESULTS: Baseline LVMi was 53.3 g/m(2) (49.2-57.2) and 69.7 g/m(2) 
      (64.2-76.1) for those with baseline ≤ 60 g/m(2) (n = 54) and LVMi > 60 g/m(2) 
      (n = 43) respectively. The adjusted difference of LVMi regression between those 
      randomized to empagliflozin and placebo were - 0.46 g/m(2) (95% CI: -3.44, 2.52, 
      p = 0.76) in the baseline LVMi ≤ 60 g/m(2) subgroup and - 7.26 g/m(2) (95% CI: 
      -11.40, -3.12, p = 0.0011) in the baseline LVMi > 60 g/m(2) subgroup 
      (p-for-interaction = 0.007). No significant associations were found between 
      baseline LVMi and 6-month change in LV end systolic volume-indexed 
      (p-for-interaction = 0.086), LV end diastolic volume-indexed 
      (p-for-interaction = 0.34), or LV ejection fraction (p-for-interaction = 0.15). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with higher LVMi at baseline experienced greater LVM 
      regression with empagliflozin.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by endothelial dysfunction that 
      causes micro- and macrovascular complications. Low intensity therapeutic 
      ultrasound (LITUS) may improve endothelial function, but its effects have not 
      been investigated in these patients. The aim of our study was to compare the 
      effects of pulsed (PUT) and continuous (CUT) waveforms of LITUS on the 
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation of T2DM patients. The present randomized 
      crossover trial had a sample of twenty-three patients (7 men) diagnosed with 
      T2DM, 55.6 (±9.1) years old, with a body mass index of 28.6 (±3.3) kg/m2. All 
      patients were randomized and submitted to different waveforms (Placebo, CUT, and 
      PUT) of LITUS and the arterial endothelial function was evaluated. The LITUS of 1 
      MHz was applied in pulsed (PUT: 20% duty cycle, 0.08 W/cm2 SATA), continuous 
      (CUT: 0.4 W/cm2 SPTA), and Placebo (equipment off) types of waves during 5 min on 
      the brachial artery. Endothelial function was evaluated using the flow-mediated 
      dilation (FMD) technique. PUT (mean difference 2.08%, 95% confidence interval 
      0.65 to 3.51) and CUT (mean difference 2.32%, 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 
      3.74) increased the %FMD compared to Placebo. In the effect size analysis, PUT 
      (d=0.65) and CUT (d=0.65) waveforms presented moderate effects in the %FMD 
      compared to Placebo. The vasodilator effect was similar in the different types of 
      waves. Pulsed and continuous waveforms of LITUS of 1 MHz improved the arterial 
      endothelial function in T2DM patients.

TI  - A Pilot Study on the Efficacy of a Diabetic Diet Containing the Rare Sugar 
      D-Allulose in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Prospective, Randomized, 
      Single-Blind, Crossover Study.

AB  - High sugar consumption increases the risk of diabetes, obesity, and 
      cardiovascular diseases. Regarding the diet of patients with diabetes, artificial 
      sweeteners are considered a safe alternative to sugar; however, there is also a 
      risk that artificial sweeteners exacerbate glucose metabolism. D-allulose (C-3 
      isomer of d-fructose), which is a rare sugar, has been reported to have 
      antidiabetic and antiobesity effects. In this study, the efficacy of a diabetic 
      diet containing D-allulose was investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      using an intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring system (isCGM). 
      This study was a validated, prospective, single-blind, randomized, crossover 
      comparative study. Comparison of peak postprandial blood glucose (PPG) levels 
      after consumption of a standard diabetic diet and a diabetic diet containing 8.5 
      g of D-allulose was the primary endpoint. A D-allulose-containing diabetic diet 
      improved PPG levels in type two diabetes patients compared with a strictly 
      energy-controlled diabetic diet. The results also showed a protective effect on 
      endogenous pancreatic insulin secretory capacity owing to reduced insulin 
      requirement. In patients with type two diabetes mellitus, diabetic diets 
      containing 8.5 g D-allulose were effective in improving PPG levels.

TI  - Decreased branched-chain amino acids and elevated fatty acids during antecedent 
      hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes.
LID - e003327 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/bmjdrc-2023-003327 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypoglycemia is a major limiting factor in achieving recommended 
      glycemic targets for people with type 1 diabetes. Exposure to recurrent 
      hypoglycemia results in blunted hormonal counter-regulatory and symptomatic 
      responses to hypoglycemia. Limited data on metabolic adaptation to recurrent 
      hypoglycemia are available. This study examined the acute metabolic responses to 
      hypoglycemia and the effect of antecedent hypoglycemia on these responses in type 
      1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one outpatients with type 1 
      diabetes with normal or impaired awareness of hypoglycemia participated in a 
      study assessing the response to hypoglycemia on 2 consecutive days by a 
      hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp. Participants underwent a period of normoglycemia 
      and a period of hypoglycemia during the hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp. Plasma 
      samples were taken during normoglycemia and at the beginning and the end of the 
      hypoglycemic period. Metabolomic analysis of the plasma samples was conducted 
      using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass 
      spectrometry. RESULTS: In total, 68 metabolites were studied. On day 1, 
      concentrations of the branched-chain amino acids, leucine (p=3.8×10(-3)) and 
      isoleucine (p=2.2×10(-3)), decreased during hypoglycemia. On day 2, during 
      hypoglycemia, five amino acids (including leucine and isoleucine) significantly 
      decreased, and two fatty acids (tetradecanoic and oleic acids) significantly 
      increased (p<0.05). Although more metabolites responded to hypoglycemia on day 2, 
      the responses of the single metabolites were not statistically significant 
      between the 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with type 1 diabetes, one episode 
      of hypoglycemia decreases leucine and isoleucine concentrations. Antecedent 
      hypoglycemia results in the decrement of five amino acids and increases the 
      concentrations of two fatty acids, suggesting an alteration between the two 
      hypoglycemic episodes, which could indicate a possible adaptation. However, more 
      studies are needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of 
      these alterations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01337362.

TI  - Effects of a Web-Based Lifestyle Intervention on Weight Loss and Cardiometabolic 
      Risk Factors in Adults With Overweight and Obesity: Randomized Controlled 
      Clinical Trial.
PG  - e43426
LID - 10.2196/43426 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high proportion of people with overweight and obesity has become 
      a worldwide problem in recent decades, mainly due to health consequences, such as 
      cardiovascular diseases, neoplasia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Regarding 
      effective countermeasures, the digitization of health services offers numerous 
      potentials, which, however, have not yet been sufficiently evaluated. Web-based 
      health programs are becoming increasingly interactive and can provide individuals 
      with effective long-term weight management support. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of 
      this randomized controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of an 
      interactive web-based weight loss program on anthropometric, cardiometabolic, and 
      behavioral variables and to compare it with a noninteractive web-based weight 
      loss program. METHODS: The randomized controlled trial included people who were 
      aged between 18 and 65 years (mean 48.92, SD 11.17 years) and had a BMI of 27.5 
      to 34.9 kg/m(2) (mean 30.71, SD 2.13 kg/m(2)). Participants (n=153) were assigned 
      to either (1) an interactive and fully automated web-based health program 
      (intervention) or (2) a noninteractive web-based health program (control). The 
      intervention program focused on dietary energy density and allowed for dietary 
      documentation with appropriate feedback on energy density and nutrients. The 
      control group only received information on weight loss and energy density, but 
      the website did not contain interactive content. Examinations were performed at 
      baseline (t0), at the end of the 12-week intervention (t1), and at 6 months (t2) 
      and 12 months (t3) thereafter. The primary outcome was body weight. The secondary 
      outcomes were cardiometabolic variables as well as dietary and physical activity 
      behaviors. Robust linear mixed models were used to evaluate the primary and 
      secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The intervention group showed significant 
      improvements in anthropometric variables, such as body weight (P=.004), waist 
      circumference (P=.002), and fat mass (P=.02), compared with the control group 
      over the course of the study. The mean weight loss after the 12-month follow-up 
      was 4.18 kg (4.7%) in the intervention group versus 1.29 kg (1.5%) in the control 
      group compared with the initial weight. The results of the nutritional analysis 
      showed that the energy density concept was significantly better implemented in 
      the intervention group. Significant differences in cardiometabolic variables were 
      not detected between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The interactive web-based health 
      program was effective in reducing body weight and improving body composition in 
      adults with overweight and obesity. However, these improvements were not 
      associated with relevant changes in cardiometabolic variables, although it should 
      be noted that the study population was predominantly metabolically healthy. TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trigger finger is a common disease with a lifetime prevalence of 2%. 
      One of the frequently preferred non-surgical treatments is blinded injection 
      around the A1 pulley. This study aims to compare the clinical results of 
      ultrasound-guided and blinded corticosteroid injection in the trigger finger. 
      METHODS: In this prospective clinical study, 66 patients who had persistent 
      symptoms of a single trigger finger were included. Patients with similar baseline 
      characteristics such as age, gender, triggering period, and comorbidities were 
      randomized. 34 patients had ultrasound-guided (UG), and 32 had blinded injections 
      (BG). QDASH, VAS, time to return to work, and complications were compared between 
      the groups. RESULTS: The mean age was 52,66 (29-73) years. There were 18 male and 
      48 female patients. In the UG, the triggering resolved faster, returning to work 
      was earlier, and the medication period was shorter (p < 0.05). A total of 17 
      patients who had diabetes mellitus received re-injections, 11 of which were in BG 
      and 6 in UG (p < 0.05). Although statistically significantly lower scores were 
      obtained in UG at the 1st and 4th weeks in the QDASH and VAS scores (p < 0.05), 
      at the 12th and 24 weeks, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Using ultrasound guidance for corticosteroid injections is more 
      effective for treating trigger fingers than the blinded method, leading to better 
      results and a faster return to work in the early stages of treatment.

TI  - How pictorial warnings change parents' purchases of sugar-sweetened beverage for 
      their children: mechanisms of impact.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pictorial health warnings on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a 
      promising policy for preventing diet-related disease in children. A recent study 
      found that pictorial warnings reduced parents' purchases of SSBs for their 
      children by 17%. However, the psychological mechanisms through which warnings 
      affect parental behavior remain unknown. We aimed to identify the mechanisms that 
      explain how pictorial warnings affect parents' SSB purchasing behavior for their 
      children using secondary data from a randomized trial. METHODS: In 2020-2021, 
      parents of children ages 2 to 12 years (n = 325) completed a shopping task in a 
      convenience store laboratory in North Carolina, USA. Participants were randomly 
      assigned to a pictorial warnings arm (SSBs displayed pictorial health warnings 
      about type 2 diabetes and heart damage) or a control arm (SSBs displayed a 
      barcode label). Parents then bought a beverage for their child and took a survey 
      measuring 11 potential psychological mediators, selected based on health behavior 
      theories and a model explaining the impact of tobacco warnings. We conducted 
      simple mediation analyses to identify which of the 11 mechanisms mediated the 
      impact of exposure to pictorial warnings on purchasing any SSBs for their 
      children. RESULTS: Two of the 11 constructs were statistically significant 
      mediators. First, the impact of pictorial warnings on the likelihood of 
      purchasing any SSB was mediated by parents' perceptions that SSBs were healthier 
      for their child (mediated effect= -0.17; 95% CI = - 0.33, - 0.05). Second, 
      parents' intentions to serve SSBs to their children also mediated the effect of 
      warnings on likelihood of purchasing any SSB (mediated effect= -0.07, 95% 
      CI=-0.21, - 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Pictorial warnings reduced parents' purchases of 
      SSBs for their children by making parents think SSBs are less healthful for their 
      children and reducing their intentions to serve SSBs to their children. 
      Communication approaches that target healthfulness perceptions and intentions to 
      serve SSBs may motivate parents to buy fewer SSBs for their children.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may negatively affect offspring 
      outcomes. A lifestyle intervention may therefore not only improve maternal, but 
      also offspring outcomes. The effects of lifestyle interventions on birth, 
      anthropometric, and psychobehavioral outcomes in offspring of women with GDM need 
      further evidence. DESIGN: The MySweetheart trial is a monocentric single-blind 
      randomized controlled trial in 211 women with GDM. It tested the effect of a pre- 
      and postpartum multidimensional interdisciplinary lifestyle and psychosocial 
      intervention focusing on both the mothers and their infants and its effects on 
      maternal (primary outcomes) and offspring (secondary outcomes) metabolic and 
      psychobehavioral outcomes compared with guidelines-based usual-care. This paper 
      focuses on offspring's birth, anthropometric, and maternal report of 
      psychobehavioral outcomes at singular timepoints. METHODS: Women with GDM aged 
      ≥18 years, between 24-32 weeks of gestation, speaking French or English were 
      included and randomly allocated to either the intervention or to an active 
      guidelines-based usual-care group using a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention 
      lasted from pregnancy until 1 year postpartum and focused on improving diet, 
      physical activity, and mental health in the mother. For the offspring it focused 
      on supporting breastfeeding, delaying the timing of introduction of solid foods, 
      reducing the consumption of sweetened beverages, increasing physical activity of 
      the family, and improving parental responsiveness to infant distress, hunger, 
      satiety and sleeping cues, and difficult behavior. RESULTS: Adverse birth and 
      neonatal outcomes rarely occurred overall. There were no differences between 
      groups in offspring birth, neonatal, anthropometric, or psychobehavioral outcomes 
      up to one year. After adjustments for maternal age and the offspring's sex and 
      age, there was a borderline significant between-group difference in birth length 
      (β:-0.64, CI:-1.27; -0.01, p: 0.05), i.e., offspring of mothers in the 
      intervention group were born 0.64 cm shorter compared to those in the usual-care 
      group. CONCLUSION: This is the first pre- and postpartum multidimensional 
      interdisciplinary lifestyle and psychosocial intervention in GDM focusing on both 
      the mother and the offspring. It did not lead to a significant improvement in 
      most birth, anthropometric, and psychobehavioral outcomes in offspring of women 
      with GDM. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02890693.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the long-term effects of tofogliflozin, a 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, on atherosclerosis progression 
      and major clinical parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes lacking an 
      apparent history of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: This was a prospective 
      observational 2-year extension study of the "Using TOfogliflozin for Possible 
      better Intervention against Atherosclerosis for type 2 diabetes patients 
      (UTOPIA)" trial, a 2-year randomized intervention study. The primary endpoints 
      represented changes in the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). Secondary 
      endpoints included brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and biomarkers for 
      glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, renal function, and cardiovascular risks. 
      RESULTS: The mean IMT of the common carotid artery (IMT-CCA) significantly 
      decreased in both the tofogliflozin (- 0.067 mm, standard error 0.009, p < 0.001) 
      and conventional treatment groups (- 0.080 mm, SE 0.009, p < 0.001) throughout 
      the follow-up period; however, no significant intergroup differences in the 
      changes (0.013 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 0.012 to 0.037, p = 0.32) were 
      observed in a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. baPWV significantly 
      increased in the conventional treatment group (82.7 ± 210.3 cm/s, p = 0.008) but 
      not in the tofogliflozin group (- 17.5 ± 221.3 cm/s, p = 0.54), resulting in a 
      significant intergroup difference in changes (- 100.2 cm/s, 95% CI - 182.8 to 
      - 17.5, p = 0.018). Compared to the conventional treatment group, tofogliflozin 
      significantly improved the hemoglobin A1c and high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol levels, body mass index, abdominal circumference, and systolic blood 
      pressure. The frequencies of total and serious adverse events did not vary 
      significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Tofogliflozin was not associated 
      with improved inhibition of carotid wall thickening but exerted long-term 
      positive effects on various cardiovascular risk factors and baPWV while showing a 
      good safety profile.

AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy of the Occupational Therapy Diabetes 
      Self-Management intervention (OTDSM) to enhance glycemic stability and 
      self-management skills in people with diabetes type-2. Based on this single-blind 
      randomized trial, 30 subjects with diabetes type-2 were assigned to two groups of 
      intervention and control. The intervention group received a 10-week program, 
      consisting of four group visits and six individualized sessions. The control 
      group received an individual session and three weekly phone calls. The primary 
      study outcome, blood hemoglobin A1C, was measured before and three months after 
      the study. The secondary outcome was assessed in terms of the participants' 
      self-management behaviors, self-efficacy, diabetes distress, depressive symptoms, 
      and performance and satisfaction with daily activities. These outcomes were 
      evaluated three times: before, one month into, and three months after the study. 
      The study findings demonstrated significant differences between the two groups in 
      the hemoglobin A1C levels, self-management behaviors, self-efficacy, and 
      performance and satisfaction with daily routines after the intervention 
      (P < 0.05). No significant differences existed between the groups for the extent 
      of diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. Inclusion of occupational therapy 
      protocol into the plan of care for people with diabetes can improve health 
      outcomes by promoting their routine participation in self-management activities.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To reduce added-sugar consumption, jurisdictions are considering 
      requiring restaurant menu labels to identify high-added-sugar items. This study 
      examined the impacts of added-sugar warning labels on hypothetical choices, 
      knowledge of items' added-sugar content, and perceptions of high-added-sugar 
      items. STUDY DESIGN: The design was an online RCT. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: National 
      sample of adults (N=15,496) was recruited to approximate the U.S. distribution of 
      sex, age, race, ethnicity, and education. INTERVENTION: Participants viewed 
      fast-food and full-service restaurant menus displaying no warning labels 
      (control) or icon-only added-sugar warning labels next to high-added-sugar items 
      (containing >50% of the daily recommended limit). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main 
      outcome measures were hypothetical ordering of ≥1 high-added-sugar item, grams of 
      added sugar ordered, and knowledge of items' added-sugar content assessed in 2021 
      and analyzed in 2021-2022. RESULTS: Warning labels reduced the relative 
      probability of ordering ≥1 high-added-sugar item by 2.2% (probability 
      ratio=0.978, 95% CI=0.964, 0.992; p=0.002); improved knowledge of added-sugar 
      content (p<0.001); and led to a nonstatistically significant reduction of 1.5 
      grams of added sugar ordered, averaged across menus (p=0.07). The label modestly 
      reduced the appeal of high-added-sugar items, increased perceptions that 
      consuming such items often will increase Type 2 diabetes risk, increased 
      perceived control over eating decisions, and increased injunctive norms about 
      limiting consumption of high-added-sugar items (ps<0.001). However, in the 
      warning condition, only 47% noticed nutrition labels, and 21% recalled seeing 
      added-sugar labels. When restricting the warning condition to those who noticed 
      the label, the result for grams of added sugar ordered was significant, with the 
      warning condition ordering 4.9 fewer grams than the controls (95% CI= -7.3, -2.5; 
      p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Added-sugar warning labels reduced the probability of 
      ordering a high-added-sugar menu item and increased participants' knowledge of 
      whether items contained >50% of the daily value for added sugar. The modest 
      magnitudes of effects may be due to low label noticeability. Menu warning labels 
      should be designed for noticeability. REGISTRATION: This study was registered at

TI  - The Effectiveness of a Traditional Chinese Medicine-Based Mobile Health App for 
      Individuals With Prediabetes: Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e41099
LID - 10.2196/41099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theories assert that body 
      constitution and meridian energy lay the foundation for disease prevention. 
      TCM-based health concepts have not yet been incorporated into mobile health 
      (mHealth) apps for individuals with prediabetes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study 
      was to examine the effectiveness of a TCM mHealth app for individuals with 
      prediabetes. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial recruited 121 individuals 
      with prediabetes at a teaching hospital in New Taipei City between February 2020 
      and May 2021. The participants were randomly assigned to the TCM mHealth app 
      group (n=42), ordinary mHealth app group (n=41), or control group (n=38). All 
      participants received the usual care that included 15-20 minutes of health 
      education about the disease, along with healthy diet and exercise encouragement. 
      The ordinary mHealth app included physical activity (PA), diet, and disease 
      education, along with individual records. The TCM mHealth app additionally 
      included qi and body constitution information, along with constitution-based PA 
      and diet advice. The control group received the usual care alone and did not have 
      access to any app. Data were collected at baseline, at the end of the 12-week 
      intervention, and 1 month after the intervention. Body constitution, including 
      yang-deficiency, yin-deficiency, and phlegm-stasis, was measured according to the 
      Body Constitution Questionnaire, with higher scores indicating a greater 
      deficiency. Body energy was examined using the Meridian Energy Analysis Device. 
      The Short-Form 36 questionnaire was used to evaluate health-related quality of 
      life (HRQOL), which yielded physical component scores and mental component 
      scores, with higher scores indicating better physical and mental aspects of 
      HRQOL, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the TCM mHealth app 
      group showed greater improvement in hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), yang-deficiency 
      and phlegm-stasis body constitution, and BMI; however, no significant differences 
      were found in these outcomes between the TCM mHealth app and ordinary mHealth app 
      groups. The TCM mHealth app group showed better improvement in body energy and 
      mental component scores than the ordinary mHealth app group. There were no 
      significant differences in fasting plasma glucose, yin-deficiency body 
      constitution, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary behavior, and total 
      PA among the three groups after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Use of either the 
      ordinary or TCM mHealth app improved HRQOL among individuals with prediabetes. 
      Compared to the outcomes of controls not using any app, use of the TCM mHealth 
      app was effective at improving HbA(1c), BMI, yang-deficiency and phlegm-stasis 
      body constitution, and HRQOL. Moreover, using the TCM mHealth app seemed to 
      improve the body energy and HRQOL more than when using the ordinary mHealth app. 
      Further studies with a larger sample size and longer follow-up period may be 
      necessary to determine whether the differences favoring the TCM app are 
      clinically meaningful. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04096989;

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes has been increasing, 
      and the nurse is a primary healthcare provider to patients when health 
      professionals are scarce in the community setting. A feasible intervention 
      delivered by nurses is necessary to fulfill patients' needs to help them achieve 
      glycemic control. AIM: To investigate whether Thai adults with uncontrolled 
      diabetes in community hospitals lack self-care competency and whether a nurse-led 
      supportive education program can enhance their self-care skills, change behavior, 
      and control HbA1C levels. METHODS: We employed a multi-community hospital cluster 
      randomized controlled trial design. Participants were randomly selected in the 
      experimental group (2 hospitals) and control group (2 hospitals), with 30 
      patients from each hospital. One hundred twenty adults with HbA1c 7-10% treated 
      by oral glycemic medication were recruited. Using Orem's Theory as a framework, 
      nurses implemented self-care deficit assessments and supportive-educative nursing 
      programs into their work. Participants in the control group received usual care, 
      and those in the experimental group underwent a nurse assessment and supportive 
      education measures. Data were collected at baseline, with 4-week and 12-week 
      follow-ups. Data analysis were a repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc analysis, 
      and Independent t-test. RESULTS: One hundred three patients completed the trial 
      (51 in the experimental group and 52 in the control group). At 12 weeks, there 
      were statistically significant improvements in HbA1c (P < .001), fasting plasma 
      glucose (P = .03), knowledge (P < .001), diabetes self-care agency (P < .001), 
      diet consumption (P < .001), physical activity (P < .001), and medical adherence 
      (P = .03) in the experimental group significantly greater than those in the 
      control group. Also, the between-group effect sizes were 0.49 or greater. 
      CONCLUSION: The self-care deficit assessment and supportive education program 
      were essential to the nursing intervention that effectively improved knowledge, 
      changed behavior, and HbA1c levels among adults with uncontrolled blood glucose.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of treatment on 
      pregnancy outcomes among women who had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 5.1-5.6 
      mmol/l in the first trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: We performed a 
      secondary-analysis of a randomized community non-inferiority trial of gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) screening. All pregnant women with FPG values range 
      5.1-5.6 mmol/l in the first trimester of gestation were included in the present 
      study (n=3297) and classified to either the (i) intervention group who received 
      treatment for GDM along with usual prenatal care (n=1,198), (ii) control group 
      who received usual-prenatal-care (n=2,099). Macrosomia/large for gestational age 
      (LGA) and primary cesarean-section (C-S) were considered as primary-outcomes. A 
      modified-Poisson-regression for binary outcome data with a log link function and 
      robust error variance was used to RR (95%CI) for the associations between GDM 
      status and incidence of pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: The mean maternal age and 
      BMI of pregnant women in both study groups were similar. There were no 
      statistically significant differences in the adjusted risks of adverse pregnancy 
      outcomes, including macrosomia, primary C-S, preterm birth, hyperbilirubinemia, 
      preeclampsia, NICU-admission, birth trauma, and LBW both groups. CONCLUSIONS: It 
      is found that treating women with first-trimester FPG values of 5.1-5.6 mmol/l 
      could not improve adverse pregnancy outcomes including macrosomia, Primary C-S, 
      Preterm birth, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, preeclampsia, NICU admission, Birth 
      trauma and LBW. Therefore, extrapolating the FPG cut-off point of the second 
      trimester to the first -which has been proposed by the IADPSG, might therefore 
      not be appropriate. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://www.irct.ir/trial/518,

TI  - Non-severe hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes: a randomized crossover trial 
      comparing two quantities of oral carbohydrates at different insulin-induced 
      hypoglycemia ranges.

LID - 1186680
AB  - AIMS: Non-severe hypoglycemia (NS-H) is challenging for people living with type 1 
      diabetes (PWT1D) and often results from relative iatrogenic hyper-insulinemia. 
      Current guidelines recommend a one-size-fits-all approach of 15-20 g of simple 
      carbohydrates (CHO) every 15 min regardless of the triggering conditions of the 
      NS-H event. We aimed to test different amounts of CHO to treat insulin-induced 
      NS-H at various glucose ranges. METHODS: This is a randomized, four-way, 
      crossover study involving PWT1D, testing NS-H treatment outcomes with 16 g vs. 
      32 g CHO at two plasma glucose (PG) ranges: A: 3.0-3.5 mmol/L and B: <3.0 mmol/L. 
      Across all study arms, participants consumed an additional 16 g of CHO if PG was 
      still <3.0 mmol/L at 15 min and <4.0 mmol/L at 45 min post-initial treatment. 
      Subcutaneous insulin was used in a fasting state to induce NS-H. Participants had 
      frequent venous sampling of PG, insulin, and glucagon levels. RESULTS: 
      Participants (n = 32; 56% female participants) had a mean (SD) age of 46.1 (17.1) 
      years, had HbA1c at 54.0 (6.8 mmol/mol) [7.1% (0.9%)], and had a diabetes 
      duration of 27.5 (17.0) years; 56% were insulin pump users. We compared NS-H 
      correction parameters between 16 g and 32 g of CHO for range A, 3.0-3.5 mmol/L (n 
      = 32), and range B, <3.0 mmol/L (n = 29). Change in PG at 15 min for A: 0.1 (0.8) 
      mmol/L vs. 0.6 (0.9) mmol/L, p = 0.02; and for B: 0.8 (0.9) mmol/L vs. 0.8 (1.0) 
      mmol/L, p = 1.0. Percentage of participants with corrected episodes at 15 min: 
      (A) 19% vs. 47%, p = 0.09; (B) 21% vs. 24%, p = 1.0. A second treatment was 
      necessary in (A) 50% vs. 15% of participants, p = 0.001; (B) 45% vs. 34% of 
      participants, p = 0.37. No statistically significant differences in insulin and 
      glucagon parameters were observed. CONCLUSIONS: NS-H, in the context of 
      hyper-insulinemia, is difficult to treat in PWT1D. Initial consumption of 32 g of 
      CHO revealed some advantages at the 3.0-3.5 mmol/L range. This was not reproduced 
      at lower PG ranges since participants needed additional CHO regardless of the 
      amount of initial consumption. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov,

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent episodes of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients with 
      diabetes mellitus can result in hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF), 
      which is characterized by a compromised response to hypoglycemia by 
      counterregulatory hormones (counterregulatory response; CRR) and hypoglycemia 
      unawareness. HAAF is a leading cause of morbidity in diabetes and often hinders 
      optimal regulation of blood glucose levels. Yet, the molecular pathways 
      underlying HAAF remain incompletely described. We previously reported that in 
      mice, ghrelin is permissive for the usual CRR to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. 
      Here, we tested the hypothesis that attenuated release of ghrelin both results 
      from HAAF and contributes to HAAF. METHODS: C57BL/6N mice, ghrelin-knockout (KO) 
      + control mice, and GhIRKO (ghrelin cell-selective insulin receptor knockout) + 
      control mice were randomized to one of three treatment groups: a "Euglycemia" 
      group was injected with saline and remained euglycemic; a 1X hypoglycemia ("1X 
      Hypo") group underwent a single episode of insulin-induced hypoglycemia; a 
      recurrent hypoglycemia ("Recurrent Hypo") group underwent repeated episodes of 
      insulin-induced hypoglycemia over five successive days. RESULTS: Recurrent 
      hypoglycemia exaggerated the reduction in blood glucose (by ~30%) and attenuated 
      the elevations in plasma levels of the CRR hormones glucagon (by 64.5%) and 
      epinephrine (by 52.9%) in C57BL/6N mice compared to a single hypoglycemic 
      episode. Yet, plasma ghrelin was equivalently reduced in "1X Hypo" and "Recurrent 
      Hypo" C57BL/6N mice. Ghrelin-KO mice exhibited neither exaggerated hypoglycemia 
      in response to recurrent hypoglycemia, nor any additional attenuation in CRR 
      hormone levels compared to wild-type littermates. Also, in response to recurrent 
      hypoglycemia, GhIRKO mice exhibited nearly identical blood glucose and plasma CRR 
      hormone levels as littermates with intact insulin receptor expression (floxed-IR 
      mice), despite higher plasma ghrelin in GhIRKO mice. CONCLUSIONS: These data 
      suggest that the usual reduction of plasma ghrelin due to insulin-induced 
      hypoglycemia is unaltered by recurrent hypoglycemia and that ghrelin does not 
      impact blood glucose or the blunted CRR hormone responses during recurrent 
      hypoglycemia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia has been recognized as a third category of complications in 
      people with diabetes. However, few studies focus on the reduction of skeletal 
      muscle mass in young people with diabetes. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate risk factors of pre-sarcopenia in young patients with diabetes and 
      establish a practical tool to diagnose pre-sarcopenia in those people. METHODS: 
      Patients (n = 1246) enrolled from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
      Survey (NHANES) cycle year of 2011 to 2018 were randomly divided into the 
      training set and validation set. The all-subsets regression analysis was used to 
      select the risk factors of pre-sarcopenia. A nomogram model for the prediction of 
      pre-sarcopenia in the diabetic population was established based on the risk 
      factors. The model was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve for discrimination, calibration curves for calibration, and 
      decision curve analysis curves for clinical utility. RESULTS: In this study, 
      gender, height, and waist circumference were elected as predictive factors for 
      pre-sarcopenia. The nomogram model presented excellent discrimination in training 
      and validation sets with areas under the curve of 0.907 and 0.912, respectively. 
      The calibration curve illustrated excellent calibration, and the decision curve 
      analysis showed a wide range of good clinical utility. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      develops a novel nomogram that integrates gender, height, and waist circumference 
      and can be used to easily predict pre-sarcopenia in diabetics. The novel screen 
      tool is accurate, specific, and low-cost, highlighting its potential value in 
      clinical application.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing among adolescents and 
      clear strategies are needed to prevent it. The aim of this study was to determine 
      the effect of peer education on knowledge, health beliefs and preventive 
      behaviors of type 2 diabetes in female adolescents. METHODS: In this cluster 
      randomized trial study, 168 students (84 people in each group) were enrolled. The 
      data collection instrument was a questionnaire of knowledge (30 questions), 
      health beliefs (16 questions) and behavior (20 questions) whose validity and 
      reliability were confirmed. Then eight capable students were chosen as peer 
      educators after being trained. The intervention group received 8 sessions of 
      90-min education through training, lectures, question and answer, and group 
      discussion and with teaching aids such as pamphlets, educational clips and text 
      messages. The post-test was administered two months after the treatment. Data 
      collected using software SPSS16 and Chi-Square and ANCOVA test were used. 
      RESULTS: The result showed that the mean and standard deviation of general 
      knowledge, disease symptoms, behavioral risk factors, mid-term outcomes and 
      long-term outcomes, perceived self-efficacy, behavioral beliefs, perceived 
      susceptibility, perceived severity, prevention of stress, healthy food/healthy 
      diet, unhealthy food/unhealthy diet, high-risk behavior, and self-care in the 
      intervention group has increased significantly 2 months after intervention 
      compared of control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Peer education increased 
      knowledge and improved adolescents' health beliefs and behaviors. Therefore, 
      training in adolescence in order to prevention of diabetes can be considered as 
      an effective step, and the use of peer-led education in this field is 
      recommended. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial registration number IRCT20200811048361N1

TI  - Efficacy and safety of luseogliflozin in Caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes: 
      results from a phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.
LID - 10.1136/bmjdrc-2022-003290 [doi]
LID - e003290
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Most data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of luseogliflozin 
      (luseo) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) originate from the 
      Japanese population. This study evaluated luseo versus placebo (PCB) as add-on to 
      metformin in a Caucasian population with inadequately controlled T2DM. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
      PCB-controlled, parallel-group study. Patients aged 18-75 years with inadequately 
      controlled T2DM (glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥7% to ≤10% (≥53 to ≤86 mmol/mol)) 
      despite a diet and exercise program and on a stable metformin regimen were 
      eligible. Patients were randomized to one of three luseo groups (2.5, 5.0 and 
      10.0 mg) or PCB for 12 weeks (W12). The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c 
      expressed as least-square means from baseline (W0) to W12. RESULTS: A total of 
      328 patients were randomized: PCB (n=83) and luseo 2.5 mg (n=80), 5.0 mg (n=86), 
      and 10.0 mg (n=79). Mean age (±SD) was 58.5±8.8 years; 64.6% were women; body 
      mass index was 31.5±3.4 kg/m(2); and HbA1c was 8.54±0.70. At W12, mean reductions 
      in HbA1c from W0 were -0.98%, -1.09%, -1.18%, and -0.73% in the luseo 2.5, 5.0 
      and 10.0 mg, and PCB groups, respectively, all of which were statistically 
      significant. Compared with PCB, HbA1c levels were significantly decreased by 
      0.25% (p=0.045), 0.36% (p=0.006), and 0.45% (p=0.001) in the luseo 2.5, 5.0, and 
      10.0 mg groups, respectively. In all luseo dose groups, reductions in body weight 
      were statistically significant compared with PCB. Data from the safety analysis 
      were consistent with the known luseo safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: All doses of 
      luseo as add-on to metformin in Caucasian patients with uncontrolled T2DM 
      demonstrated significant efficacy in decreasing HbA1c after W12 of treatment.

TI  - Effect of Mobile Phone Text Messaging Self-Management Support for Patients With 
      Diabetes or Coronary Heart Disease in a Chronic Disease Management Program 
      (SupportMe) on Blood Pressure: Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e38275
LID - 10.2196/38275 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maintaining engagement and support for patients with chronic diseases 
      is challenging. SMS text messaging programs have complemented patient care in a 
      variety of situations. However, such programs have not been widely translated 
      into routine care. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the implementation and utility 
      of a customized SMS text message-based support program for patients with type 2 
      diabetes (T2D), coronary heart disease, or both within a chronic disease 
      integrated care program. METHODS: We conducted a 6-month pragmatic 
      parallel-group, single-blind randomized controlled trial that recruited people 
      with T2D or coronary heart disease. Intervention participants received 4 
      semipersonalized SMS text messages per week providing self-management support to 
      supplement standard care. Preprogrammed algorithms customized content based on 
      participant characteristics, and the messages were sent at random times of the 
      day and in random order by a fully automated SMS text messaging engine. Control 
      participants received standard care and only administrative SMS text messages. 
      The primary outcome was systolic blood pressure. Evaluations were conducted face 
      to face whenever possible by researchers blinded to randomization. Participants 
      with T2D were evaluated for glycated hemoglobin level. Participant-reported 
      experience measures were evaluated using questionnaires and focus groups and 
      summarized using proportions and thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 902 
      participants were randomized (n=448, 49.7% to the intervention group and n=454, 
      50.3% to the control group). Primary outcome data were available for 89.5% 
      (807/902) of the participants. At 6 months, there was no difference in systolic 
      blood pressure between the intervention and control arms (adjusted mean 
      difference=0.9 mm Hg, 95% CI -1.1 to 2.1; P=.38). Of 642 participants with T2D, 
      there was no difference in glycated hemoglobin (adjusted mean difference=0.1%, 
      95% CI -0.1% to 0.3%; P=.35). Self-reported medication adherence was better in 
      the intervention group (relative risk=0.82, 95% CI 0.68-1.00; P=.045). 
      Participants reported that the SMS text messages were useful (298/344, 86.6%) and 
      easily understood (336/344, 97.7%) and motivated change (217/344, 63.1%). The 
      lack of bidirectional messaging was identified as a barrier. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      intervention did not improve blood pressure in this cohort, possibly because of 
      high clinician commitment to improved routine patient care as part of the chronic 
      disease management program as well as favorable baseline metrics. There was high 
      program engagement, acceptability, and perceived value. Feasibility as part of an 
      integrated care program was demonstrated. SMS text messaging programs may 
      supplement chronic disease management and support self-care. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - AIMS: SMARTEST is a register-based randomized clinical trial (RRCT) that compares 
      dapagliflozin to metformin in early-stage type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome 
      includes progression of microvascular complications based on data from the 
      Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR). In this sub-study, the aim was to 
      validate microvascular complication variables in the NDR against electronic 
      health records (EHRs). METHODS: Data were extracted from EHRs of 276 SMARTEST 
      participants with a median observation period of 3 years in the Uppsala, Örebro 
      and Sörmland counties and compared with NDR data. Agreement was determined for 
      all corresponding data entries as well as for progression of microvascular 
      complications after randomization. RESULTS: The agreement for all corresponding 
      data entries was 98.9% (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient 0.999) for creatinine 
      and eGFR, 95.1% for albuminuria, 91.6% for foot-at-risk and 98.2% for retinopathy 
      status (Kappa 0.67-0.91). The agreement for progression of microvascular 
      complications was 98.0% for CKD stage, 98.9% for albuminuria grade, 96.3% for 
      foot-at-risk grade and 99.6% for retinopathy grade progression (Gwet's AC(1) 
      0.96-1.00). CONCLUSION: Microvascular complication variables in the NDR show good 
      agreement with EHR data. The use of a well-established national health care 
      registry, exemplified by the NDR, for endpoint collection in RRCTs such as 
      SMARTEST is supported by this study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cytoflavin 
      in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Investigational therapy was administered in two steps: intravenous infusions of 
      experimental drug/placebo for 10 days followed by oral administration for 75 
      days. In 10 clinical centers, 216 patients aged 45-74 years with a diagnosis of 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus, symptomatic distal sensorimotor DPN, confirmed no 
      earlier than 1 year before screening, on stable therapy (no change of drugs and 
      doses) by oral hypoglycemic drugs, intermediate-acting, long-acting or 
      extra-long-acting insulin, and/or GLP-1 receptor agonists. RESULTS: By the end of 
      treatment, the change of the Total Symptom Score (TSS) in the experimental group 
      was -2.65 points, in the placebo group -1.73 points (p<0.001). Improvement of 
      symptoms in the experimental group was achieved regardless of the degree of 
      compensation for type 2 diabetes (both in those with Hb1Ac <8.0% and in those 
      with Hb1Ac ≥8.0%), but demonstrated better results in patients with less severe 
      baseline symptoms (TSS <7.5). Improvement in the components of the TSS scale 
      «paresthesia» and «numbness» occurred as early as on day 11 of therapy; by the 
      end of treatment, a significant decrease in the «burning» component was also 
      demonstrated. The experimental drug had a positive safety profile. CONCLUSION: 
      Cytoflavin, intravenous solution and enteric-coated tablets (SPTF Polysan Ltd.) 
      is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of DPN.

TI  - Yoga Practice Facilitates Prefrontal Oxygenation and Working Memory in Type 2 
      Diabetes Mellitus Patients: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 24-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with cognitive decline. 
      Lifestyle behaviors such as yoga practices play a significant role in preventing 
      cognitive decline. PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess the effect of 
      yoga intervention on working memory and prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation in 
      T2DM patients. METHODS: Twenty T2DM participants, aged between 40 and 60 years, 
      volunteered for a 6-week study. Participants were randomized into a yoga practice 
      (n = 10) and a waitlist control group (n = 10). The n-back task was administered 
      to evaluate working memory before and after the intervention. While performing 
      the working memory task, PFC oxygenation was monitored using functional 
      near-infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: The yoga group showed a significant 
      improvement in working memory performance. The accuracy improved in 1-back (mean 
      difference of 4.73%, 95% CI[0.69,8.77], P = .026) and 2-back (8.0%, 95% 
      CI[1.89,14.1], P = .016) task conditions. The reaction time improved in 0-back 
      (mean difference of -79.07 milliseconds, 95% CI[-128.3,-29.8]), 1-back (mean 
      difference of -119.17 milliseconds, 95% CI[-217.5,-20.8] ) and 2-back (-76.06 
      milliseconds, 95% CI[-148.8,-3.3]) task conditions. In the yoga group, at 
      post-intervention, higher oxygenation was observed during 0-back and 1-back task 
      conditions (Beta coefficient mean difference of 211.3, 95% CI[2.8, 420.0], P = 
      .048 and 80.5, 95% CI [3.7,157.2], P = .042 respectively) in the left PFC region 
      compared to the pre-intervention values. The control group showed no significant 
      change in working memory performance and PFC oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: The study 
      suggests that yoga practice may improve working memory performance and facilitate 
      higher PFC oxygenation in T2DM patients. Further studies with a larger sample and 
      a longer intervention period are required to strengthen the findings.

TI  - Cardiorenal protective effects of canagliflozin in CREDENCE according to glucose 
      lowering.
LID - 10.1136/bmjdrc-2022-003270 [doi]
LID - e003270
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Relationships between glycemic-lowering effects of sodium glucose 
      co-transporter 2 inhibitors and impact on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes are 
      uncertain. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 4395 individuals with 
      prebaseline and postbaseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) randomized to canagliflozin 
      (n=2193) or placebo (n=2202) in The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes 
      with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation trial. Effects on HbA1c were 
      assessed using mixed models. Mediation of treatment effects by achieved glycemic 
      control was analyzed using proportional hazards regression with and without 
      adjustment for achieved HbA1c. End points included combined kidney or 
      cardiovascular death, end-stage kidney disease or doubling of serum creatinine 
      (primary trial outcome), and individual end point components. RESULTS: HbA1c 
      lowering was modified by baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 
      For baseline eGFR 60-90, 45-59, and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2), overall HbA1c 
      (canagliflozin vs placebo) decreased by -0.24%, -0.14%, and -0.08% respectively 
      and likelihood of >0.5% decrease in HbA1c decreased with ORs of 1.47 (95% CI 1.27 
      to 1.67), 1.12 (0.94 to 1.33) and 0.99 (0.83 to 1.18), respectively. Adjustment 
      for postbaseline HbA1c marginally attenuated canagliflozin effects on primary and 
      kidney composite outcomes: unadjusted HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.80) and 0.66 (95% 
      CI 0.53 to 0.81); adjusted for week 13 HbA1c, HR 0.71 (95% CI 0.060 to 0.84) and 
      0.68 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.83). Results adjusted for time-varying HbA1c or HbA1c as a 
      cubic spline were similar and consistent with preserved clinical benefits across 
      a range of excellent and poor glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: The glycemic effects 
      of canagliflozin are attenuated at lower eGFR but effects on kidney and cardiac 
      end points are preserved. Non-glycemic effects may be primarily responsible for 
      the kidney and cardioprotective benefits of canagliflozin.22.

TI  - Effect of Occupational Therapy in Promoting Medication Adherence in Primary Care: 
      A Randomized Controlled Trial.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The Integrative Medication Self-Management Intervention (IMedS) is a 
      manualized occupational therapy intervention designed to improve adherence to 
      medications. The intervention influences medication adherence and facilitates new 
      medication habits and routines; however, it has not been tested in a community 
      clinical setting. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of the IMedS to address 
      medication adherence rates among community-dwelling adults with hypertension 
      (HTN), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), or both. DESIGN: Randomized controlled 
      trial using a pretest-posttest control group design. SETTING: Primary care clinic 
      in a large federally qualified health center. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with 
      uncontrolled HTN, T2DM, or both. INTERVENTION: Participants were divided into two 
      groups: The control group received treatment as usual (TAU) per the primary care 
      protocol, and the intervention IMedS group received TAU and the IMedS 
      intervention. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome: seven-item version of the 
      Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale (ARMS-7), pill count, blood pressure, 
      hemoglobin A1c, or all of these. RESULTS: The proportion of adherent participants 
      increased in both groups, but between groups, changes were not statistically 
      significant. Post hoc comparisons of the results of a mixed analysis of variance 
      for ARMS-7 measurements indicated that the occupational therapy intervention had 
      a unique effect, compared with that for the TAU control group (dc = 0.65). Effect 
      scores for pill count (d = 0.55) also suggested that the occupational therapy 
      intervention positively affected adherence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Occupational therapists can provide assessment and intervention to positively 
      influence medication adherence in a primary care setting. What This Article Adds: 
      This article provides a better understanding of the occupational therapist's role 
      in addressing medication management and adherence on the interdisciplinary 
      primary care medical team.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of study was to evaluate the effect and safety of 
      pioglitazone-metformin combined treatment in the newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes 
      patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. METHODS: A total of 120 newly 
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease from 8 
      centers were randomly divided into the control group (metformin hydrochloride) 
      and the test group (pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride). 
      RESULTS: Compared to the control group, after treatment, the proportion of people 
      with mild and moderate fatty liver increased, and the proportion of people with 
      severe fatty liver decreased, and this change was more obvious in the population 
      with moderate and severe fatty liver. The level of γ-GT decreased in both groups 
      before and after treatment, which was statistically significant, and there was 
      also a statistically significant difference in the level of γ-GT between the two 
      groups after 24 weeks. There were no significant statistically differences in 
      blood lipid, body weight, and waist circumference between the test group and the 
      control group. Logistic regression analysis found that BMI is one of the risk 
      factors for fatty liver. There was also no significant difference in the 
      incidence of serious adverse events between the two groups (control group: 10.00% 
      and test group: 6.67%, P = 0.74). CONCLUSION: Combined treatment with 
      pioglitazone-metformin can effectively reduce liver fat content and gamma-GT 
      level in newly diagnosed diabetic patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 
      and adverse events do not increase compared with the control group, showing good 
      safety and tolerance. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
      NCT03796975.

TI  - Jinlida granules combined with metformin improved the standard-reaching rate of

      analysis of a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1142327

LID - 1142327
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies found that Jinlida granules could significantly 
      reduce blood glucose levels and enhance the low-glucose action of metformin. 
      However, the role of Jinlida in the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and 
      improving clinical symptoms has yet to be studied. We aimed to elaborate on the 
      efficacy of Jinlida in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients who experience clinical 
      symptoms based on secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: 
      Data were analyzed from a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 
      Jinlida. The standard-reaching rate of blood glucose, the symptom disappearance 
      rate, the symptom improvement rate, the efficacy of single symptoms, and the 
      total symptom score were evaluated. The correlation between HbA1c and the 
      improvement of clinical symptoms was analyzed. RESULTS: For 12 weeks straight, 
      192 T2D patients were randomly assigned to receive either Jinlida or a placebo. 
      The treatment group showed statistically significant differences in the 
      standard-reaching rate of HbA1c < 6.5% (p = 0.046) and 2hPG (< 10 mmol/L, 11.1 
      mmol/L) (p < 0.001), compared with the control group. The standard-reaching rate 
      of HbA1c < 7% (p = 0.06) and FBG < 7.0 mmol/L (p = 0.079) were not significantly 
      different between the treatment and control groups. Five symptoms exhibited a 
      statistical difference in symptom disappearance rate (p < 0.05). All the symptoms 
      exhibited a significant difference in symptom improvement rate (p < 0.05). The 
      mean change in total symptom score from baseline to week 12 was -5.45 ± 3.98 in 
      the treatment group and -2.38 ± 3.11 in the control group, with statistically 
      significant differences (p < 0.001). No significant correlations were noted 
      between symptom improvement and HbA1c after 12 weeks of continuous intervention 
      with Jinlida granules or placebo. CONCLUSION: Jinlida granules can effectively 
      improve the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and clinical symptoms of T2D 
      patients, including thirst, fatigue, increased eating with rapid hungering, 
      polyuria, dry mouth, spontaneous sweating, night sweat, vexing heat in the chest, 
      palms, and soles, and constipation. Jinlida granules can be used as an effective 
      adjuvant treatment for T2D patients who experience those symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The assessment of accurate mortality risk is essential for managing 
      pneumonia patients with connective tissue disease (CTD) treated with 
      glucocorticoids or/and immunosuppressants. This study aimed to construct a 
      nomogram for predicting 90-day mortality in pneumonia patients using machine 
      learning. METHODS: Data were obtained from the DRYAD database. Pneumonia patients 
      with CTD were screened. The samples were randomly divided into a training cohort 
      (70%) and a validation cohort (30%). A univariate Cox regression analysis was 
      used to screen for prognostic variables in the training cohort. Prognostic 
      variables were entered into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
      (Lasso) and a random survival forest (RSF) analysis was used to screen important 
      prognostic variables. The overlapping prognostic variables of the two algorithms 
      were entered into the stepwise Cox regression analysis to screen the main 
      prognostic variables and construct a model. Model predictive power was assessed 
      using the C-index, the calibration curve, and the clinical subgroup analysis 
      (age, gender, interstitial lung disease, diabetes mellitus). The clinical 
      benefits of the model were assessed using a decision curve analysis (DCA). 
      Similarly, the C-index was calculated and the calibration curve was plotted to 
      verify the model stability in the validation cohort. RESULTS: A total of 368 
      pneumonia patients with CTD (training cohort: 247; validation cohort: 121) 
      treated with glucocorticoids or/and immunosuppressants were included. The 
      univariate Cox regression analysis obtained 19 prognostic variables. Lasso and 
      RSF algorithms obtained eight overlapping variables. The overlapping variables 
      were entered into a stepwise Cox regression to obtain five variables (fever, 
      cyanosis, blood urea nitrogen, ganciclovir treatment, and anti-pseudomonas 
      treatment), and a prognostic model was constructed based on the five variables. 
      The C-index of the construction nomogram of the training cohort was 0.808. The 
      calibration curve, DCA results, and clinical subgroup analysis showed that the 
      model also had good predictive power. Similarly, the C-index of the model in the 
      validation cohort was 0.762 and the calibration curve had good predictive value. 
      CONCLUSION: In this study, the nomogram developed performed well in predicting 
      the 90-day risk of death in pneumonia patients with CTD treated with 
      glucocorticoids or/and immunosuppressants.

AB  - Metformin, a frontline therapy for type 2 diabetes and related metabolic 
      diseases, results in variable outcomes. This study aimed to investigate whether 
      sweetened beverages (caloric or non-caloric) affect the therapeutic benefits of 
      metformin on glucose, food intake, and weight loss in diet-induced obesity. Mice 
      were given a high-fat diet and sweetened water for 8 weeks to induce obesity and 
      glucose intolerance. Then, mice were randomized to receive metformin in either 
      water, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), or the non-nutritive sweetener saccharin 
      for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks of metformin treatment, all groups had improved 
      glucose tolerance compared to pretreatment. However, saccharin resulted in worse 
      glucose tolerance and weight gain outcomes than the water or HFCS groups and 
      correlated with lower plasma growth differentiation factor 15 levels. In 
      conclusion, reducing non-nutritive sweetener consumption during metformin therapy 
      is recommended to avoid impairing the therapeutic effects of metformin on body 
      weight and glucose homeostasis.

TI  - Inflammatory Mediators and Type 2 Diabetes Risk Factors before and in Response to 
      Lifestyle Intervention among Latino Adolescents with Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/nu15112442 [doi]
LID - 2442
AB  - Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation that may contribute to T2D among 
      youth. We examined the association between inflammatory biomarkers and insulin 
      sensitivity and β-cell function and response to lifestyle intervention among 
      Latino youth with obesity. Latino youth (n = 64) were randomized to six months of 
      lifestyle intervention (INT, n = 40) or usual care (UC, n = 24). INT included 
      nutrition education and physical activity. UC involved meeting with a pediatric 
      endocrinologist and registered dietitian to discuss healthy lifestyles. At 
      baseline, multiple linear regression assessed fasting serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), 
      high-molecular weight adiponectin (HMW Adpn), IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist 
      (IL-1ra) as predictors of insulin sensitivity (whole-body insulin sensitivity 
      index, WBISI) and β-cell function (oral disposition index, oDI). Changes in 
      outcomes between groups were assessed using covariance pattern models. At 
      baseline, MCP-1 (β ± SE, -0.12 ± 0.05, p = 0.027) and IL-1ra (-0.03 ± 0.01, p = 
      0.005) were negatively associated with WBISI. Treatment effects were not observed 
      for inflammatory markers. WBISI was significantly increased among both INT (from 
      1.8 ± 0.2 to 2.6 ± 0.4, p = 0.005) and UC (from 1.6 ± 0.2 to 2.8 ± 0.5, p = 
      0.002) with no significant differences between the groups. Obesity-related 
      inflammatory mediators were associated with T2D risk factors but were unaffected 
      by lifestyle intervention among Latino youth.
