OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of resistance training on the anxiety symptoms
and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: Thirty-five elderly patients were randomly divided into two groups: 17
patients in the control group and 18 in the intervention group. All patients
maintained standard pharmacological treatment for Parkinson's disease, but the
intervention group participated in a 24-week resistance training program. The
anxiety symptoms were assessed through the Beck's Anxiety Inventory, and quality
of life by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39.
RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in anxiety level and increase in
quality of life after 24 weeks of resistance training.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate that resistance training
is an effective intervention in the reduction of anxiety symptoms and improves
the quality of life in elderly people with Parkinson's disease.
