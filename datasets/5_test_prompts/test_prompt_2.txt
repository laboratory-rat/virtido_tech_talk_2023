OBJECTIVE: Women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus rarely receive the 
recommended 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after delivery. We sought 
to determine whether postal reminders to be sent after delivery to a patient, 
her physician, or both would increase screening rates.
STUDY DESIGN: Patients were assigned randomly to 4 groups: reminders sent to 
both physician and patient, to physician but not patient, or to patient but not 
physician or no reminders were sent. The primary outcome was the proportion of 
patients who underwent an OGTT within 1 year after delivery. The secondary 
outcome was the performance of other postpartum screening tests.
RESULTS: OGTT rates were significantly increased in the physician/patient 
reminder group (49/81 women; 60.5%), in the patient-only reminder group (42/76 
women; 55.3%), and in the physician-only reminder group (16/31 women; 51.6%) 
compared with the no reminder group (5/35 women; 14.3%; P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Postpartum reminders greatly increased screening rates for women 
with gestational diabetes mellitus.
